        "questions": "Objective: To assess the understanding of the factors affecting concrete strength and durability, specifically compressive strength.\n\nShort Answer:\n\n1. A concrete cylinder with a diameter of 150mm and height of 300mm failed at a load of 250 kN during a compression test. Calculate the compressive strength of the concrete. What would this value signify in terms of the concrete's suitability for a typical residential building project?\n\n2.  Explain how the water-cement ratio influences the compressive strength of concrete. Provide a practical example of how this ratio can be controlled on a construction site.\n\n3.  A construction project specifies a target compressive strength for the concrete. However, the concrete delivered to the site exhibits a lower strength than required. List three potential causes for this discrepancy, relating to factors discussed in the lectures.\n\n4.  Describe the role of curing in influencing the long-term durability and strength of concrete.  How might inadequate curing manifest itself in the structure over time?\n\n5.  Differentiate between the influence of early-age and long-term strength gain on the overall durability of concrete.\n\n6. You are tasked with designing a concrete mix for a bridge pier requiring high compressive strength.  Suggest two specific adjustments to the concrete mix design that would help achieve this goal.  Briefly explain the mechanism by which each adjustment affects the strength.\n\n7.  Two concrete samples, A and B, were tested for compressive strength. Sample A was cured in standard conditions, while sample B was cured in a hot, dry environment. Assuming all other factors are identical, which sample would likely exhibit a lower compressive strength and why?\n\n8.  Describe how the presence of air voids within the concrete matrix affects its compressive strength. How is this effect different from the effect of larger voids due to improper compaction?\n\n9.  Aside from compressive strength, name one other important mechanical property of concrete discussed in the lectures and explain how it influences the overall performance of a concrete structure.\n\n10.  A concrete specimen shows signs of surface scaling after a winter season.  Relate this observation to a potential issue with the concrete mix design or construction process discussed in the lectures, focusing on its impact on durability."
